## Instructor

Office location: 1207F Genomics <br>
Office hours: Tue & Thu 4:30 - 5:30 PM 


## Description

Introduction to algorithms, statistical methods and data analysis programming
routines relevant for genome biology. The class consists of three
main components: lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The
lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis, phylogenetics,
comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, network biology and more.
The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and course projects
focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data using
command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R.
Credit: 4 units (2x 1.5 hours lectures, 1 hour discussion)

## Objectives of course

- Acquire understanding of algorithms used in bioinformatics
- Obtain hands-on experience in large scale data analysis.

## Prerequisites
The main prerequisite for this course is a strong interest in acquiring the
skills required for mastering the computational aspects of modern genome
research.

## Structure of course
Two lectures per week (1.5 hours each) plus one discussion section (1 hour).
During the first weeks the discussion section will be used for data analysis
tutorials using Linux command-line tools and R. 

## Time
Lecture: Tue/Thu 2:10-3:30 PM <br>
Discussion: Thu 3:40-4:30 PM

## Location
[2130 CHASS Interdisciplinary Bldg-South (INST)](http://classrooms.cmsdev.ucr.edu/buildings/chassINTS/2130.html)

## Grading
1. Homework assignments: 40%
2. Scientific paper presentation: 20%
3. Course project presentations: 20%
4. Final project report: 20%

__Grading policy:__ Given the diverse educational background of the students in GEN242, all assignments are designed to be solvable by students from both experimental and quantitative disciplines, including those with no or only limited prior experience in programming and/or data modeling. The weight of each of the four gradable components in this class is given above in percent. 
__(1)__ The homeworks include 8-10 assignments throughout the class. They cover algorithms and data analysis programming problems using the R language. The grading of these assignments is mainly based on correctness, reproducibility and reusability of the analysis code. 
__(2-4)__ Students will work in groups of 3-5 members on a Challenge Project addressing a specific data analysis problem in genome data sciences. As part of their project, students will present a scientific paper __(2)__ closely related to their project (see reading list for details). The results of the Challenge Projects __(3)__ will be presented and discussed by each student at the end of the course. In addition, each student will write a detailed analysis report __(4)__ of the assigned course project. The latter will be written in the style of a scientific publication and should include a detailed description of the results including all analysis code to fully reproduce the project results followed by a critical discussion of the outcomes. The grading of both the paper and project presentations __(2-3)__ includes anonymous feedback from all students as well as the instructor, where understanding of the material, clarity of the oral presentations and critical thinking are the main grading criteria. The final project reports __(4)__ will be graded by the instructor with an emphasis on scientific and coding accuracy, overall understanding of the topic, as well as reproducibility of the results.

## Materials needed
Students are expected to bring to each class meeting a laptop with a functional wireless
connection and a recent internet browser version (e.g. Firefox, Chrome or
Safari) preinstalled. Tablet computers with mobile operating systems are not
suitable for running the required software. User accounts on a research
computer cluster will be provided at the beginning of the course. To log in to
the cluster, students also need to install a terminal application for their
operating system (_e.g._ [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) on OS X,
and [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) or 
[MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) on Windows) as well as a file exchange software such as
[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client). In
addition, a recent version of [R](http://www.r-project.org) and
[RStudio](http://rstudio.org) should be installed on each laptop.
