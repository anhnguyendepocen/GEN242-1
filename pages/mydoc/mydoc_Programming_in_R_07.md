## Short Overview of Package Building Process

R packages can be built with the `package.skeleton` function. The given example will create a directory named `mypackage` containing the skeleton of the package for all functions, methods and classes defined in the R script(s) passed on to the `code_files` argument. The basic structure of the package directory is described [here](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r#Progr_pack). The package directory will also contain a file named `Read-and-delete-me` with instructions for completing the package:


```r
package.skeleton(name="mypackage", code_files=c("script1.R", "script2.R"))
```

Once a package skeleton is available one can build the package from the command-line (Linux/OS X). This will create a tarball of the package with its version number encoded in the file name. Subequently, the package tarball needs to be checked for errors with:


```r
R CMD build mypackage
R CMD check mypackage_1.0.tar.gz
```

Install package from source

```r
install.packages("mypackage_1.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL) 
```
